Folder description:
    - This folder contains codes corresponding to materials representation methods 
    - I try to implement well known methods, such as, OFM or CM
    - Input file follows a special structure, in detail: {"Atoms": array [1,n] of atoms, "Coords": array [n,3] of xyz coordination which corresponds to atoms, "lattice_vector": array [3,3], "Properties": optional}. You can also add any feature you want.

Usage:
  - Input file follows above format
  - Out put: one feature will be added in to input file (feature of representation)
